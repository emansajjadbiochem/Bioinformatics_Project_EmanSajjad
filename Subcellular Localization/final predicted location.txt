Final predicted location + justification
Nucleus
Justification:
TargetP analysis detected no mitochondrial targeting peptide or signal peptide, excluding mitochondrial and secretory pathways. PSORT predicted nuclear localization, and InterPro domain analysis identified a bHLH transcription factor (ILR3-like) domain, which requires nuclear access for DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. Collectively, these results strongly support nuclear localization of the protein.
