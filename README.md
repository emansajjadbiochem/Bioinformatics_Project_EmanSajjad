the given raw DNA sequence corresponds to highly conserved protein, the transcription factore ILR3 like, transcript variant X1 , mRNa. we performed the DNA, RNA and protein analysis using the bioinformatics tools to characterize it and have a deep insight into its structure, function, and interactions. at the end , i would like to thank my esteemed Professor, dr. SAMINA SHAKEEL for guiding us learning the bioinformatics tools.
