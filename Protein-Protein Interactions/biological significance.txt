Protein–Protein Interaction (STRING) Analysis: Biological Significance
The STRING interaction map illustrates the protein–protein interaction network of the ILR3 protein. The network shows multiple interacting partners, indicating that ILR3 functions as part of a complex regulatory system rather than acting alone.
ILR3 is shown to interact with proteins involved in:
•	Iron homeostasis
•	Auxin signaling
•	Root development
•	Transcriptional regulation
The dense connectivity observed in the STRING network suggests that ILR3 acts as a hub protein, coordinating signals between different biological pathways. Strong interaction edges indicate high-confidence functional associations supported by experimental data, co-expression, or curated databases.
Biologically, this interaction network supports the role of ILR3 as a key regulatory transcription factor involved in maintaining cellular balance, especially under nutrient-limited or stress conditions. Disruption of ILR3 or its interacting partners could therefore affect multiple downstream processes, emphasizing its functional importance in plant physiology.
