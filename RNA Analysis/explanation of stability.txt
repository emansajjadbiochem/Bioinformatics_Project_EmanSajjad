Explanation of RNA Structural Stability
The predicted RNA secondary structure shows a minimum free energy (MFE) of –206.50 kcal/mol, which indicates a thermodynamically stable structure. In general, a more negative free energy value reflects stronger base pairing interactions and greater structural stability.
The free energy of the thermodynamic ensemble is –220.05 kcal/mol, which is lower than the MFE value. This suggests that the RNA molecule does not exist in a single fixed conformation but rather adopts multiple alternative secondary structures whose combined stability is greater than that of any single structure.
The frequency of the MFE structure in the ensemble is 0.00%, indicating that although this structure is theoretically the most stable, it is rarely adopted under physiological conditions. Instead, the RNA fluctuates among many near-optimal structures.
The ensemble diversity value of 181.08 is very high, showing a large structural variability within the ensemble. This reflects a highly flexible and dynamic RNA molecule with many possible folding patterns.
