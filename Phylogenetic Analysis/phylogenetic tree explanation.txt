Phylogenetic Tree: Explanation 
The phylogenetic tree was constructed to analyze the evolutionary relationship of the ILR3-like transcription factor protein across different plant species. The tree is based on multiple sequence alignment of homologous protein sequences obtained from various plant taxa.
In the phylogenetic tree, closely related species cluster together, indicating a high degree of sequence similarity and evolutionary conservation. For example, species belonging to the Solanaceae family (such as Solanum, Capsicum, Nicotiana, and Lycopersicon) form tight clades, suggesting that the ILR3-like protein has been conserved during evolution within this family. This conservation implies that the protein performs essential biological functions that are maintained across related species.
More distantly related species appear on separate branches, reflecting sequence divergence due to evolutionary distance. The presence of hypothetical or unnamed proteins clustering with annotated ILR3-like proteins suggests that these proteins are likely to share similar functional roles, even if they are not yet fully characterized.
Overall, the phylogenetic analysis demonstrates that the ILR3-like transcription factor is evolutionarily conserved, supporting its importance in plant growth, development, and stress response pathways.
