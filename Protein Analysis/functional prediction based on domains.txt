Functional prediction based on domains (summary)
Based on the InterProScan results, this protein can be functionally predicted as follows:
Predicted Protein Type
Basic Helix–Loop–Helix (bHLH) transcription factor
(ILR3-like family)
Key Domains Identified & Their Functions
1. bHLH domain (basic Helix–Loop–Helix)
Enables DNA binding, typically to E-box motifs (CANNTG)
Facilitates transcriptional regulation of target genes
The protein acts as a transcription regulator, turning genes on or off
2. HLH (Helix–Loop–Helix) region
Mediates protein–protein interactions
Allows homodimer or heterodimer formation with other bHLH proteins
Dimerization is essential for DNA binding specificity and stability
3. Conserved residues
Indicative of evolutionarily conserved functional importance
Often involved in DNA binding and dimer interface formation
Confirms the protein is functionally active, not a pseudogene
Overall Functional Prediction:
This protein is likely a nuclear transcription factor
 It regulates gene expression by:
Binding DNA via the bHLH domain
Forming dimers via the HLH motif
As an ILR3-like protein, it is commonly associated with:
Developmental regulation
Metal ion homeostasis (especially iron-related pathways, in plants)
Stress and hormonal response regulation
